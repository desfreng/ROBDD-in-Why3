# ROBDD-in-Why3

You will find here my work on the verification of an implementation of the Binary Decision Diagram in Why3. This implementation ensures optimal time and memory complexity thanks to the use of hash-consigning and memoisation.

This project is being carried out as part of an internship with the Toccata team at Inria, supervised by Jean-Christophe Filliatre and Andrei Paskievich. The other part of the internship is available on the following GitHub repository: [Split-in-Why3](https://github.com/desfreng/Split-in-Why3).
